# iOS 11 Vision Example
This project uses iOS 11 SDKs along with [Microsoft's Resnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and [Google's Inceptionv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) networks for computer vision. It allows for realtime image recognition using your device's camera. It has only been tested on an iPad Pro thus far.

Here is an example of the application predicting that it's looking at a backpack:
